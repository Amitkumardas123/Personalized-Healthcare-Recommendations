# Personalized-Healthcare-Recommendations

# Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a dataset, including data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and comparison. Various machine learning models are applied to the dataset, and their performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics. The primary goal is to identify the most effective model for predicting the target variable, with a particular focus on recall due to class imbalance.
